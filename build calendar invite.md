IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE // TEMPORAL_SYNC_V1.0This document outlines the architectural requirements for integrating branded calendar invites into the Nodal Point CRM. The goal is to transform a standard task creation event into a high-fidelity diagnostic invitation.01 // UI INTEGRATION: TASK_SIDEBAR_MODALPlacement & Component StrategyThe Transmit Calendar Invite toggle must be positioned directly beneath the Chrono_Anchor (Time Selection) and above the Heatmap_Intensity (Priority) section in the TaskCreationPanel.tsx.Visual Specs (Obsidian & Glass)Component Type: Full-width toggle button (not a standard checkbox).Idle State: bg-black/20, border-white/5, text-zinc-500. Label: [ STANDBY ].Active State: bg-[#002FA7]/10, border-[#002FA7]/50, text-white. Label: [ PAYLOAD_ATTACHED ].Haptic Signal: When engaged, the button should feature a 2px Klein Blue pulsing LED dot (animate-pulse) on the right margin to signify active uplink preparation.Logic PayloadThe handleSubmit function must detect the sendCalendarInvite boolean. If true, the metadata object transmitted to the backend must include:{
  "syncCalendar": true,
  "inviteContext": "forensic_diagnostic"
}
02 // EMAIL ARCHITECTURE: THE FORENSIC INVITATIONThe email transmitted to the contact is an Instrument of Precision. It must leverage the native calendar capabilities of modern mail clients while maintaining the Nodal Point aesthetic.Subject Line ProtocolFormat: Energy Briefing Invite // [CONTACT_NAME]Example: Energy Briefing Invite // Larry JohnsonThe Dual-Layer InterfaceTo maximize conversion, the email utilizes a hybrid layout:System Layer (Top):The backend must transmit the .ics file with method=REQUEST. This triggers the native Gmail/Outlook Yes / Maybe / No block at the top of the email. This is the primary commitment vector.Branded Payload Layer (Body):Utilizes the Zinc-950 theme defined in briefing_email_preview.html.Header: Personalized greeting (e.g., Calibration for Larry Johnson).Data Grid: Use forensic labels: Chrono_Target, Node_Context, and Operational_Vector.No Redundant Buttons: Per the "Steve Jobs" rules, we remove the white "Accept" button to avoid ocular clutter, relying entirely on the native client controls.03 // AGENTIC LOGIC: INTEL_BRIEFING GENERATIONWhen an AI agent generates the Intel_Briefing payload for the email, it must adhere to the Signal Architect voice protocol:Tone: Diagnostic, not persuasive.Keywords: Variance, Mitigation, Volatility, Load Analysis, Calibration.Structure:Confirm session initialization.Identify a specific sector risk (e.g., variance in the LZ_NORTH node).Define the session objective (e.g., stabilize account profile against Q2 volatility).Example AI Output:"Diagnostic session initialized for [Name]. Automated load analysis identifies a pending variance in the [Load Zone] sector. This session will calibrate mitigation protocols to stabilize the [Account Name] profile against structural leakage."04 // TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION: .ICS PAYLOADTo ensure the native "Yes/No/Maybe" buttons appear, the .ics file must be attached with the following headers:Content-Type: text/calendar; charset=utf-8; method=REQUESTContent-Transfer-Encoding: Base64System Integrity Check: All timestamps must be transmitted in UTC ISO 8601 and resolved to the contact's local timezone via the crm-platform TZ settings.STATUS: NOMINAL // DOCUMENT_ID: NP-TEMP-SYNC-2026
