# Vercel CPU Usage Analysis - Power Choosers CRM

## Alert Summary
Your Power Choosers CRM project has used **75% of the monthly included Fluid Active CPU** on the Vercel Pro plan. Once you hit 16 hours, additional usage costs $1.28 per 10 hours.

## Potential Causes of High CPU Usage

### 1. **Frequent Cron Job Execution** ⚠️ **HIGH IMPACT**
- **Issue**: Your `vercel.json` shows a cron job running every 5 minutes (`*/5 * * * *`)
- **Location**: `/api/email/automation-cron`
- **Impact**: This runs **288 times per day** (every 5 minutes × 24 hours)
- **CPU Intensive Operations**:
  - Database queries to fetch pending sequence executions
  - Email processing and sending via SendGrid
  - Variable replacement in email templates
  - Firebase Firestore operations

**Recommendation**: Consider reducing frequency to every 15-30 minutes unless real-time processing is critical.

### 2. **Heavy AI Processing Operations** ⚠️ **HIGH IMPACT**
- **Issue**: Multiple AI-powered endpoints processing call recordings and generating insights
- **CPU Intensive Endpoints**:
  - `/api/process-call.js` - Processes call recordings with AI
  - `/api/twilio/ai-insights.js` - Generates AI insights from transcripts
  - `/api/perplexity-email.js` - AI-powered email generation
  - `/api/gemini-email.js` - Gemini AI email processing

**CPU Intensive Operations**:
- Twilio API calls for transcription
- AI model processing (Gemini, Perplexity)
- Complex text analysis and pattern matching
- Multiple retry mechanisms with delays

### 3. **Email Automation System** ⚠️ **MEDIUM-HIGH IMPACT**
- **Issue**: Automated email sequence processing
- **Location**: `/api/email/sequence-automation.js`
- **CPU Intensive Operations**:
  - Processing up to 50 pending emails per cron run
  - Variable replacement in email templates
  - SendGrid API calls
  - Database updates for sequence tracking

### 4. **Proxy Architecture Overhead** ⚠️ **MEDIUM IMPACT**
- **Issue**: Your `server.js` acts as a proxy to Vercel endpoints
- **Problem**: Double API calls - local server proxies to Vercel, which then processes
- **Impact**: Each request triggers two function executions
- **Affected Endpoints**: All Twilio, email, and AI endpoints

### 5. **Memory-Intensive Operations** ⚠️ **MEDIUM IMPACT**
- **Issue**: In-memory data storage and processing
- **Locations**:
  - Email tracking sessions stored in `global.emailTrackingSessions`
  - Email tracking events in `global.emailTrackingEvents`
  - Background data loading operations

### 6. **Frequent API Calls to External Services** ⚠️ **MEDIUM IMPACT**
- **Services**: Twilio, SendGrid, Firebase, Gemini AI, Perplexity
- **Impact**: Each external API call consumes CPU for:
  - Network requests
  - Data processing
  - Error handling and retries

## Immediate Optimization Recommendations

### 1. **Reduce Cron Frequency** (Quick Win)
```json
// In vercel.json, change from:
"schedule": "*/5 * * * *"
// To:
"schedule": "*/15 * * * *"  // Every 15 minutes instead of 5
```

### 2. **Implement Request Batching**
- Batch multiple email sends in single cron execution
- Process multiple sequence executions together
- Reduce individual API calls

### 3. **Add CPU Monitoring**
```javascript
// Add to your API endpoints:
const startTime = Date.now();
// ... your processing ...
const duration = Date.now() - startTime;
console.log(`[CPU] ${req.url} took ${duration}ms`);
```

### 4. **Optimize Database Queries**
- Add indexes to frequently queried fields
- Limit query results more aggressively
- Use pagination for large datasets

### 5. **Implement Caching**
- Cache AI responses for similar requests
- Cache email templates
- Use Redis or similar for session storage

### 6. **Remove Proxy Overhead**
- Consider deploying directly to Vercel without local proxy
- Or optimize proxy to reduce double processing

## Long-term Solutions

### 1. **Upgrade to Vercel Pro with Higher Limits**
- Current: 16 hours included
- Pro: Can purchase additional hours at $1.28 per 10 hours

### 2. **Implement Background Job Processing**
- Use a dedicated job queue (Bull, Agenda.js)
- Process heavy operations asynchronously
- Reduce real-time processing load

### 3. **Optimize AI Processing**
- Cache AI responses
- Implement request deduplication
- Use streaming responses where possible

### 4. **Database Optimization**
- Review Firestore query patterns
- Implement proper indexing
- Consider data archiving for old records

## Monitoring and Alerts

### 1. **Add CPU Usage Logging**
```javascript
// Add to each API endpoint:
console.log(`[CPU] ${req.method} ${req.url} - Processing started`);
// ... processing ...
console.log(`[CPU] ${req.method} ${req.url} - Completed in ${Date.now() - startTime}ms`);
```

### 2. **Set Up Vercel Monitoring**
- Monitor function execution times
- Set up alerts for high CPU usage
- Track memory consumption

### 3. **Database Query Monitoring**
- Log slow queries
- Monitor Firestore usage
- Track API call frequency

## Expected Impact of Optimizations

| Optimization | CPU Reduction | Implementation Time |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Reduce cron frequency | 60-70% | 5 minutes |
| Remove proxy overhead | 30-40% | 1-2 hours |
| Implement caching | 20-30% | 2-4 hours |
| Optimize AI processing | 40-50% | 4-8 hours |
| Database optimization | 15-25% | 2-6 hours |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (Today):
   - Change cron frequency to every 15 minutes
   - Add CPU usage logging to key endpoints

2. **Short-term** (This week):
   - Remove or optimize proxy architecture
   - Implement basic caching for AI responses

3. **Medium-term** (Next 2 weeks):
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement background job processing
   - Add comprehensive monitoring

4. **Long-term** (Next month):
   - Consider upgrading Vercel plan
   - Implement advanced caching strategies
   - Optimize AI processing pipeline

## Cost Analysis

- **Current**: 75% of 16 hours = 12 hours used
- **Remaining**: 4 hours before additional charges
- **Additional cost**: $1.28 per 10 hours
- **Potential monthly cost**: $3.84 - $7.68 if usage continues

By implementing these optimizations, you should be able to reduce CPU usage by 50-70%, keeping you well within the included limits and avoiding additional charges.
