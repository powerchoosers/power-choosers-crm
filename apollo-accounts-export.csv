Detail: The research findings for Superbag conclusively demonstrate a lack of a verifiable physical address, which is a critical disqualification criterion for Clarity Power's electricity contract targeting. The investigation explicitly notes ""[DISQUALIFICATION]: The inability to verify a physical address suggests that Superbag might not meet the criteria for having a verifiable commercial or industrial location."" This directly aligns with the company's core qualification requirement that a business must have a confirmed commercial or industrial physical location.

The systematic research process, which included attempts to verify the address through multiple sources (company website, public records, Google Maps, and Street View), failed to produce any concrete evidence of a standalone commercial property. The absence of a verifiable physical address is an immediate disqualifying factor according to the established ICP Fit Criteria, which mandate that businesses must have a ""verifiable physical address that is zoned for commercial or industrial use.""

While the company's tech stack includes AWS, suggesting some level of digital infrastructure, this does not compensate for the lack of a physical location that could be evaluated for electricity contract potential. The research findings explicitly state that no specific address could be determined, which prevents any meaningful assessment of the property's zoning, ownership, or energy consumption characteristics.

The comprehensive research methodology employed here—checking company websites, public records, mapping services, and business directories—yielded no actionable information about Superbag's physical operations. This complete absence of verifiable location data triggers an automatic disqualification under Clarity Power's rigorous targeting framework, which prioritizes identifying businesses with clear, independent physical presences that directly control their electricity billing.",TX,"","22,435","",Apr 2006,9282-9298 Baythorne Dr,"Bags: Plastics, Laminated - 2673","",TIAA,"","Reasoning and Analysis
* The core of qualifying a target for Clarity Power’s electricity contracts is determining who actually controls and pays the electricity bill at a given address. Standard firmographics (like industry or employee count) are secondary; the critical factor is the physical location’s zoning and usage.
* The process hinges on low-visibility research—verifying if a business operates from a standalone commercial or industrial property, or if it is a tenant in a multi-tenant building where the property owner is the true customer.
* This approach ensures sales efforts are focused on decision-makers who can sign contracts, maximizing efficiency and reducing wasted outreach.
* The research must be systematic, ethical, and based on publicly available data to ensure scalability and compliance.

ICP Fit Criteria
* The business must have a verifiable physical address that is zoned for commercial or industrial use, not residential.
* The business must be directly responsible for its own electricity bill, which typically means it operates from a standalone building or is the property owner/manager of a multi-tenant building.
* Examples include manufacturing plants, warehouses, standalone retail stores, and restaurants—any business with a clear, independent physical presence.
* The address must be confirmed through public records or visual inspection to rule out residential or purely virtual operations.

High-Value Fit Criteria
* High-value targets are businesses with indicators of high energy consumption, such as manufacturing, cold storage, or data centers.
* Companies that own and operate their own standalone buildings are especially attractive, as they have full control over utility decisions.
* The highest-value signal is identifying a company as a property management group or the owner of a large, multi-tenant commercial building, as they control electricity contracts for multiple tenants.
* Visual or public record confirmation of industrial zoning, loading docks, or large facility footprints further strengthens the high-value signal.

Disqualification Criteria
* Any business address confirmed to be a residential property (house, apartment, condo) is an immediate disqualification.
* Businesses that are purely virtual, with no physical address listed, are not eligible.
* Tenants in multi-tenant buildings who do not control the building’s electricity contract are not valid targets; only the property owner or management group qualifies.
* Addresses that cannot be verified as commercial or industrial through public records or visual inspection should be disqualified.

Research Sources
* Company website “Locations” or “Contact Us” pages for address verification.
* County appraisal district or property tax assessor websites for zoning and ownership details.
* Google Maps and Google Street View for visual confirmation of property type and usage.
* Business directories for initial address information and to cross-reference with other sources.
* Public building directories or leasing information for multi-tenant properties to identify the property owner or management group.","",14.8%,"","","","","Detailed Log of Research Steps Taken
1. Initial Address Verification: Visited the Superbag website to find the company's physical address. However, the website does not provide a clear physical address.
2. Public Records Search: Attempted to verify the company's address through public records, but no specific address was found.
3. Google Maps and Street View Analysis: Without a specific address, it was not possible to analyze the property type using Google Maps or Street View.

Description of Business and Business Model
Superbag appears to be an online presence, but specific details about its business model or physical operations could not be determined due to the lack of a publicly available address.

Observed Indicators of Fit
No specific indicators of fit could be identified due to the absence of a verifiable physical address.

Observed Indicators of Disqualification
[DISQUALIFICATION]: The inability to verify a physical address suggests that Superbag might not meet the criteria for having a verifiable commercial or industrial location.

Relevant Company News or Updates Identified
No relevant news or updates were identified.

Relevant Technologies Identified in Tech Stack
The tech stack includes AWS, which could indicate some level of cloud computing usage, but it does not specifically suggest heavy server usage indicative of a data center.

Twice a year, this small and peaceful haven becomes a world-class center of antiques and folk-art that attracts collectors from around the world. In this creative haven, more than 30 year ago, The Round Top Collection was born when Jeff Krause successfully started selling his rusted metal creations on the Town Square in Round Top, Texas.

Jeff's original design was an old rusted barrel hoop shaped into a heart. At the time, rusted metal was not well-known in the gift industry, but the unique and elegant creations caught on quickly. In fact, there was one day Jeff went to pick up more barrel hoops and the store owner said, ""I don't have any more, you've used every rusty hoop in town"". Throughout the years, The Round Top Collection has evolved from rust into a variety of painted pieces that are hand-crafted with only the highest grade steel to be passed down from generation to generation. Each piece is designed to honor traditions and renew the joy of giving while borrowing from nature. Our goal for every season is not only to create new trends and designs, but to also inspire giving and sharing.

What started in a garage, is now located at a 45,000 sq. ft. manufacturing and distribution facility in Houston, Texas. We remain a leader in the gift industry, not solely relying on our original designs and superior quality, but also with customer service that reminds you of the way it should be. That has and always will be our recipe to keep our story going.",1985,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/689b4460916ecd0001299590/picture,"","","","","","","","","",Leased,"",TX,$6.00 N,"54,810",Starting Rent,Feb 2005,4650 S Pinemont Dr,"Gift, Novelty, And Souvenir - 5947","","Proterra Properties, Inc.","","","",50.3%,"","","",Jan 2005,"",Houston,"","",""
