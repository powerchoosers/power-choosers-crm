# NODAL POINT ENERGY SALES PLAYBOOK
## NEPQ + Commodity Sales Psychology Masterclass

---

## PART ONE: THE PROBLEM STATEMENT

### Why Commodity Sales Fail (And How to Fix It)

**The Commodity Trap:**
Energy contracts are commodity products. This means:
- No inherent product differentiation (kWh is kWh)
- Price becomes the only decision variable
- Buyers put you in a "race to the bottom"
- You compete on cost, not value

**The Solution: Sell the Hidden Structural Inefficiency, Not the Commodity**

When you call a prospect about "saving money on electricity," you sound like every broker. When you call to diagnose a "demand ratchet liability sitting at the 80% floor that your current contract structure built in," you sound like a forensic engineer.

**The Nodal Point Philosophy:**
Energy is not a commodity to purchase. It is a liability to optimize. Your job is not to pitch a cheaper rate. Your job is to identify the structural flaws in their current contract that are costing them money they don't even know they're losing.

---

## PART TWO: PSYCHOLOGY OF THE FIVE CORE OBJECTIONS

### Understanding the Root Cause Behind Each Objection

Objections are not rejection. Objections are information gaps. The prospect hasn't yet:
1. Understood their real problem (not just the surface issue)
2. Seen the financial consequence of NOT solving it
3. Developed internal motivation to change NOW

**NEPQ fixes this by making the prospect persuade themselves through skilled questioning.**

---

## OBJECTION #1: "WE'RE NOT INTERESTED"

### Diagnosis: You Triggered This With Your Tone, Pacing, or Words

**Why This Happens:**
- You opened with a pitch instead of a diagnostic probe
- Your tone sounded needy, urgent, or corporate
- You talked about "saving money" — everyone says that
- Your pacing was too fast (no verbal pauses = you seem pushy)

**The Psychology:**
When prospects say "not interested," 80% of the time they mean: "You haven't shown me why I should be interested yet." It's not a final answer. It's a defense mechanism against a sales pitch.

**What Went Wrong:**
```
❌ WRONG: "Hey John, I think we can save you money on your electricity bill..."
   → Triggers immediate dismissal

✅ RIGHT: "Hey John, I'm pretty sure I'm catching you at a bad time, do you have a few seconds?
   ...Awesome. So when teams in logistics renew their electricity contracts, 
   we often see hidden charges on the bill. Charges that weren't even spoken about 
   or maybe got sold at a high rate, and they don't even know where the market truly is. 
   Would this sound like something you guys are currently experiencing?"
   → Creates curiosity instead of resistance
```

**The NEPQ Fix: Re-Establish Connection with a Diagnostic Frame**

If they say "not interested," do NOT defend. Do NOT rebut. Do NOT push.

**Use the NEPQ 3-Step Formula: Clarify → Discuss → Diffuse**

**Step 1: CLARIFY (Normalize the Objection)**

```
Prospect: "We're not interested."

You: "Sure, no problem. That's completely fair. Can I ask you something though — 
     when you say not interested, is it that you're locked into a contract right now, 
     or is it more that you're just not looking at your energy spend at all?"
```

What you're doing: You're treating "not interested" as a temporary position, not permanent rejection. You're also immediately pivoting to find the REAL reason.

**Step 2: DISCUSS (Find the True Objection)**

Depending on what they say, follow up:

```
If they say, "We're locked in":
   You: "How long are you locked in for?"
   [They answer: "18 months"]
   You: "Perfect. So in 18 months, you'll want to know what the market looks like. 
         Makes sense to at least benchmark it now so when renewal comes, 
         you know if you're actually getting a fair deal."

If they say, "We're just not looking":
   You: "I get it. Most companies don't actively look unless something's triggering them to. 
        Can I ask — when was the last time someone actually sat down and showed you 
        exactly what's on your bill? Line by line?"
   [Pause. Let them answer.]
   You: "Yeah, that's what I figured. That's actually why I'm calling."
```

**Step 3: DIFFUSE (Create Internal Tension)**

```
You: "Look, I'm not saying you have to do anything right now. But here's the thing — 
     most of the logistics and warehouse teams I talk to have no idea where the real 
     inefficiencies in their contract are sitting. They think they have a problem with 
     their rate. The real problem is usually their demand profile liability. 
     
     If there was a way to see exactly what that looks like in 10 minutes, 
     would that be worth taking a quick look at?"
```

**Why This Works:**
- You normalized the objection (it's not unusual)
- You found the real reason
- You created curiosity about a specific problem (not just "savings")
- You gave them a low-friction entry point (10 minutes)

---

## OBJECTION #2: "WE'RE LOCKED INTO A CONTRACT"

### Diagnosis: This Is Your Biggest Objection. Handle It Forensically.

**Why This Happens:**
Prospects say this because they believe the contract prevents any action. They're also testing you to see if you're another broker who just wants to waste their time.

**The Psychology:**
Being "locked in" creates psychological resistance to change. The prospect feels trapped, so they push back. But this objection is actually the **easiest to dissolve if you reframe it correctly**.

**The Nodal Point Reframe:**

Energy contracts don't lock you out of optimization. They lock you IN to a liability structure. Your job is to show them that their locked-in contract has a structural flaw — and you can quantify it.

**What They Actually Mean:**
```
Surface Level: "Our contract doesn't end until 18 months from now."

Deeper Level: "I don't want to break a contract and pay penalties."

Actual Issue: "Nobody has ever shown me a reason to change that outweighs the penalty."
```

**The NEPQ 3-Step Fix: Clarify → Discuss → Diffuse**

**Step 1: CLARIFY**

```
Prospect: "We're locked into a contract for another 18 months."

You: "When you say locked in, what does that mean for you? 
     Is it that there's a termination penalty if you wanted to move, 
     or is it just that you committed to a term?"
```

Why: You're finding out if they're actually trapped or just habituated to thinking they're trapped.

**Step 2: DISCUSS**

```
If termination penalty exists:
   You: "What would that penalty look like? Do you know the number?"
   [They answer or say they don't know]
   You: "Here's what I find — most penalties are based on the assumption that 
        you're moving to a worse contract. But what if your current contract 
        has a structural inefficiency that's costing you MORE than the penalty? 
        Then the penalty isn't actually a barrier. It's the price of fixing a mistake."

If no penalty, just committed term:
   You: "So you're solid through [month/year]. Got it. 
        That's actually good information. Here's my question — 
        when you locked in 18 months ago, do you remember the criteria you used 
        to evaluate that contract? Things like your demand profile, 
        your peak usage patterns, your seasonal needs?"
   [They probably say no or don't remember]
   You: "Yeah. Most contracts are sold on price alone. But price is only 30% 
        of your actual energy liability. The other 70% comes from how your 
        contract is structured around your usage patterns."
```

**Step 3: DIFFUSE (Inject Future Panic)**

This is where NEPQ's **Consequence Questions** shine. You're not fighting the current contract. You're making them question what happens at renewal.

```
You: "So let me ask you this — when your contract comes up for renewal 
     in 18 months, do you have any visibility right now into what the market 
     actually is? Or what your real energy liability looks like?"
     
[Wait for answer]

You: "Because here's what I see happen: Companies renew based on what their 
     current broker quotes them. They have no benchmark. They don't know if 
     they're getting gouged on demand charges. They don't know if their contract 
     structure even matches their actual usage curve.
     
     By the time they realize they're overpaying, they're already locked in 
     for another three years."

[Pause]

You: "What if we took 15 minutes right now — just to pull up your bill and 
     show you what a proper structural analysis looks like? Then you'd have 
     a benchmark. When renewal comes, you'd actually KNOW what to ask for."
```

**The Psychological Leverage Here:**
You've shifted the frame from "You're locked in NOW" to "You'll be making a blind renewal decision in 18 months." That's future pain. Future pain is easier to act on than present pain.

---

## OBJECTION #3: "WE USE A BROKER / WE HANDLE THIS INTERNALLY"

### Diagnosis: This Is a Trust Issue, Not a Dismissal

**Why This Happens:**
- They have an existing vendor relationship
- They believe brokers are interchangeable (commoditized)
- They don't understand the difference between "arrangement management" and "structural analysis"
- They've been burned by brokers before

**The Psychology:**
"We have a broker" is a smokescreen. The real objection is: "Why should I replace something that's already here?" Or: "How do I know you're not just another broker?"

**The Nodal Point Reframe:**

You are not a broker. A broker arranges contracts. You are a forensic engineer. A forensic engineer diagnoses structural flaws.

**The NEPQ 3-Step Fix: Clarify → Discuss → Diffuse**

**Step 1: CLARIFY**

```
Prospect: "We already work with a broker."

You: "I hear you. Let me ask you something — when your broker originally 
     set up your contract, did they do a structural analysis of your demand profile? 
     Like, did they map your usage curve against your contract terms 
     to show you if there was a mismatch?"
     
[They almost always say no]

You: "Okay. So they got you pricing, right? But did they also quantify 
     your demand ratchet liability? Your seasonal exposure? 
     Your peak contribution to the grid?"
     
[Again, almost always no]
```

**What you're doing:** You're showing them that their broker does transactional work (pricing), not diagnostic work (structural analysis). These are completely different.

**Step 2: DISCUSS**

```
You: "Here's the difference. Your broker's job is to get you a contract. 
     My job is to show you what's actually costing you money inside that contract — 
     charges your current provider probably never even explained.
     
     Most logistics and warehouse accounts we look at have the same pattern: 
     their demand ratchet is locking them into a floor they didn't even know existed.
     
     That's not the broker's fault. It's just that nobody's ever audited it.
     
     Does that make sense?"
```

**Step 3: DIFFUSE (Create Proof of Concept)**

```
You: "Look, I don't want to step on your broker's toes. But what if we just 
     ran an audit on your bill — no commitment, no weirdness. 
     Just to show you if there's anything your current contract is doing wrong?
     
     If there's nothing, great. You've confirmed everything's fine. 
     If there IS something, then at least you know it exists. 
     You can decide what to do with that information."

[Pause]

You: "The audit takes about 20 minutes. Fair?"
```

**Why This Works:**
- You didn't attack their broker
- You reframed the conversation from "relationship replacement" to "structural diagnosis"
- You offered a low-risk proof point (just an audit, no commitment)
- You made the value tangible (either confirmation or discovery)

---

## OBJECTION #4: "WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME" (Contract Expires in 12+ Months)

### Diagnosis: No Urgency = No Action. You Must Create Internal Tension.

**Why This Happens:**
- The prospect doesn't feel pain yet (contract is stable)
- They think energy is a set-it-and-forget-it expense
- They have no benchmark, so they don't know they're losing money
- Procrastination feels safer than change

**The Psychology:**
This is where NEPQ's **Consequence Questions** become your weapon. You must make them question what happens if they do nothing.

**The Nodal Point Reframe:**

"Plenty of time" is actually the **most dangerous** position. It means they'll procrastinate until renewal, then make a reactive decision with no preparation.

**The NEPQ 3-Step Fix: Clarify → Discuss → Diffuse**

**Step 1: CLARIFY**

```
Prospect: "We have plenty of time. Our contract doesn't end for another 14 months."

You: "That's perfect timing, actually. Can I ask you something — 
     have you already started the process of shopping your renewal? 
     Like, do you have competing quotes yet?"
     
[They almost always say no]

You: "How do you mean? Are you planning to just go back to your current provider 
     and see what they quote?"
```

**Step 2: DISCUSS (Plant the Seed)**

```
You: "Okay, so here's what I see happen 90% of the time. Companies get to 
     month 11 of their contract, they call their provider and say, 'What's my renewal rate?'
     The provider gives them a quote. They either take it or shop it to one other broker. 
     They have no baseline. They don't know if the market is up or down. 
     They don't know if their demand structure is locked into a penalty.
     
     Then they sign. Three years later, they realize they got hammered.
     
     Does your company have a formal RFP process for energy renewals?"
     
[Almost always no]
```

**Step 3: DIFFUSE (Create Fear of Missing Out)**

This is the **Consequence Question**. Make them question their inaction.

```
You: "So here's my question for you — and I'm genuinely curious — 
     what happens if you do nothing between now and renewal? 
     Like, what's your plan?"
     
[They'll probably say something like, "We'll deal with it when it comes up"]

You: "Okay. Here's what concerns me. By then, you'll have 4-6 weeks to make 
     a major three-year commitment. You'll have no benchmark. 
     Your provider will control the narrative with their opening quote. 
     And you'll make a decision based on incomplete information.
     
     Not because you're bad at this. Just because nobody prepared ahead of time.
     
     What if we took 15 minutes NOW — while you have time and breathing room — 
     and just built a baseline? Then at renewal, you'd actually know 
     if the market is giving you a fair price or not."
```

**Why This Works:**
- You validated the 14 months as good timing
- You showed them the common failure pattern (procrastination → reactive decision)
- You made inaction feel risky (loss aversion)
- You reframed "plenty of time" as an opportunity to prepare, not procrastinate

---

## OBJECTION #5: "I DON'T HAVE TIME. SHOOT ME AN EMAIL SO I CAN REVIEW IT"

### Diagnosis: This Is Often a Brush-Off, But Sometimes It's Legitimate. Diagnose First.

**Why This Happens:**
- Genuinely busy (sometimes true)
- Wants to deprioritize you (more often true)
- Wants to avoid commitment in real-time
- Testing your persistence

**The Psychology:**
"Shoot me an email" is a deflection tactic. Most salespeople comply. The prospect then has no urgency to read it, and it sits in their inbox forever.

**The Nodal Point Reframe:**

An email is a commodity. It's not memorable. It's not sticky. Your job is to understand WHY they don't have time, then address that real constraint.

**The NEPQ 3-Step Fix: Clarify → Discuss → Diffuse**

**Step 1: CLARIFY**

```
Prospect: "Send me an email. I can review it when I have time."

You: "Sure, I can do that. Before I do — let me ask you something. 
     When you say you don't have time right now, is it just timing today? 
     Like, you're in meetings? Or is energy management just not on your radar right now?"
     
[Listen to the answer. This tells you everything.]
```

**If they say, "Just today, I'm slammed":**

```
You: "Got it. I get it. Quick question though — 
     even if I send you something today, when would you actually sit down to look at it? 
     A week from now? Two weeks?"
     
[Be quiet and let them answer. Their answer will tell you if this is real.]

If they say something like "Ugh, probably three weeks":
   You: "Okay, so here's the thing — in three weeks, you won't remember this call. 
        You won't remember what I said. You'll see an email from me and think, 
        'What is this?' That's not helpful for either of us.
        
        What if instead, we blocked off just 12 minutes NEXT WEEK at this same time? 
        That way, you're not distracted today, and when we talk, 
        it'll be fresh on both ends. Fair?"
```

**If they say, "Energy management isn't a priority right now":**

```
You: "That actually makes sense. Most companies don't actively manage energy 
     unless something's broken. Here's my question though — 
     do you know right now if something IS broken? 
     Like, has anyone actually looked at your bill and run a structural audit?
     
     Or is it just an assumption that everything's fine?"
     
[They'll almost always say, "I don't know"]

You: "That's actually the exact reason I called. It takes 15 minutes. 
     We pull up your bill. We show you if there are any hidden charges or 
     contract structure issues. You'll know one way or the other.
     
     Can we grab 15 minutes next Thursday at 2 PM? 
     That way you'll have concrete data instead of guessing."
```

**Step 2: DISCUSS**

The key here is to make the **email feel incomplete** without a live conversation.

```
You: "Here's the thing about an email — it can't ask questions. 
     It can't explain your specific situation. It can't address your unique contract structure.
     
     It's just generic information. And honestly, that's not useful.
     
     What IS useful is a 12-minute conversation where I see your actual bill, 
     ask you about your usage patterns, and show you exactly what I find.
     
     Then you have specific data. Not generic advice."
```

**Step 3: DIFFUSE (Get a Micro-Commitment)**

```
You: "So here's what I want to do — don't send me your email. 
     Instead, can we just grab 15 minutes next Tuesday at 11 AM? 
     That's all I need to show you what's actually happening on your account.
     
     If it's not valuable, you lose 15 minutes and move on. 
     If it IS valuable, you've got data for your renewal.
     
     Can I throw that on the calendar?"
```

**Why This Works:**
- You didn't comply with the deflection tactic
- You diagnosed their real constraint (time today vs. time availability in general)
- You made a synchronous conversation feel less risky than an async email
- You got a micro-commitment (specific time on calendar)

## PART THREE: THE PSYCHOLOGY OF COMMODITY SALES

### Why Price Wars Destroy Margin (And How to Avoid Them)

**The Commodity Trap:**

When all products are perceived as identical, buyers default to price. This is called the "race to the bottom." Everyone wins the race to the bottom the same way: by losing money.

**The Four Stages of Commodity Selling Failure:**

```
Stage 1: You compete on features ("Our provider is faster")
         ↓ Prospect says, "So is everyone else"
         
Stage 2: You compete on service ("We have better support")
         ↓ Prospect says, "Great, prove it" (impossible to prove in a sales call)
         
Stage 3: You compete on price ("We're cheaper")
         ↓ Prospect says, "I'll use you to beat up my current provider"
         
Stage 4: You compete on relationships ("We're invested in your success")
         ↓ Prospect says, "Sure, send me your lowest price"
         
RESULT: You're at the bottom. Your margin is destroyed. You're fighting for crumbs.
```

**The Nodal Point Solution: Sell the Diagnosis, Not the Commodity**

Energy is not a commodity until someone proves it is. Your job is to prove it's NOT by showing a structural inefficiency that nobody else has found.

**The Three Laws of Commodity De-Commoditization:**

**Law 1: Sell the Problem, Not the Product**

```
❌ Commodity approach: "We offer fixed-rate electricity at 7.2¢/kWh"
✅ Nodal Point approach: "Your current contract has a demand ratchet locking you 
                         into a floor you didn't know existed. That's costing you 
                         $18K/year in invisible charges."
```

The second one creates urgency. The first one creates a price discussion.

**Law 2: Create a Benchmark, Then Show Variance**

```
❌ Commodity approach: "We can save you money"
✅ Nodal Point approach: "Your contract structure should match your usage pattern. 
                         Right now, there's a 23% variance. That's the problem."
```

Specific numbers are memorable. Generic claims are forgettable.

**Law 3: Make Inaction Costly**

```
❌ Commodity approach: "When you're ready, give us a call"
✅ Nodal Point approach: "If you do nothing, this contract rolls over in 14 months 
                         and you'll make a three-year commitment with no preparation. 
                         That's how you overpay."
```

Future pain motivates action. Present comfort breeds procrastination.

## PART FOUR: THE FIVE-STAGE NEPQ SEQUENCE FOR ENERGY SALES

### How to Structure Your Call from Opening to Close

**Stage 1: Connection (First 20 seconds)**

Goal: Disarm the prospect, not alarm them. Take focus off you, put it on them.

```
YOU: "Hey John. Lewis with Nodal Point. I'm pretty sure I'm catching you 
     in the middle of something. Do you have a few seconds?"
     
WAIT FOR ANSWER

YOU: "Awesome. So when teams in logistics and warehousing go to renew 
     their electricity contracts, we often see hidden charges on their bill. 
     Charges that weren't spoke about or got sold at a high rate and they 
     don't even know where the market truly is. 
     
     Would this sound like something you guys are currently experiencing?"
```

**Stage 2: Engagement (Next 3-5 minutes)**

This is where you use NEPQ's four-part questioning structure.

**Part A: Situation Questions** (Find their current state)
```
YOU: "Can I ask — how long have you been on your current contract?"
YOU: "And when it was originally sold to you, do you remember how that process went?"
YOU: "Are you on a fixed rate or variable?"
YOU: "Who handled that originally — your CFO, an operations person?"
```

**Part B: Problem Awareness Questions** (Open the emotional door)
```
YOU: "Is there anything about your current bill that you'd change if you could?"

[They mention something or say no]

YOU: "When you say [thing they mentioned], how long has that been going on?"
YOU: "Has that had an impact on your bottom line — in what way?"
YOU: "What do you think is causing that?"
```

**Part C: Solution Awareness Questions** (Show them what's possible)
```
YOU: "So if we were able to fix [their problem], what would that mean for you? 
     Like, what's the business impact if that goes away?"
     
[They answer emotionally]

YOU: "And besides that, what else would be different?"
YOU: "How would that make you feel — being able to solve that?"
```

**Part D: Consequence Questions** (Make inaction feel risky)
```
YOU: "So let me ask you something — what happens if you do nothing about this? 
     Like, what's your plan when renewal comes up?"
     
[They probably say they'll deal with it then]

YOU: "Here's what I see happen 90% of the time [tell the story of reactive renewal]"
YOU: "What if that happened to you? How would that land?"
```

**Stage 3: Transition (Brief)**

```
YOU: "Based on everything you've told me — your usage patterns, 
     the issues with your current bill, and the fact that renewal 
     is coming up in 14 months — 
     
     I think there's a solid case for us to run a structural audit on your account. 
     Show you exactly what's costing you money and where the real opportunity is.
     
     Does that make sense?"
```

**Stage 4: Presentation (Not a Pitch — A Diagnosis)**

```
YOU: "Here's what I'm seeing. Your contract has three structural issues:

1. [Specific issue from their bill]
2. [Specific issue from their bill]
3. [Specific issue from their bill]

Each one has a dollar impact. Combined, it's costing you [number] per year.
That's the inefficiency. That's what we'd fix."
```

**Stage 5: Commitment (Get Agreement on Next Step)**

```
YOU: "So the question is — do you want to fix this before renewal, 
     or are you comfortable with the status quo?
     
     Because if you want to fix it, here's what the path looks like [explain process]
     
     If you're comfortable, no judgment. You've confirmed everything's fine.
     
     What feels right?"
```

## PART FIVE: HOW TO DISARM EACH OBJECTION IN REAL-TIME

### Quick Reference Guide

| **Objection** | **Your Response** | **NEPQ Stage** |
|---|---|---|
| "Not interested" | "Sure, no problem. When you say not interested, is it that you're locked in, or is it more that you don't want to look at energy at all right now?" | Clarify |
| "We're locked in" | "Perfect. So when you renew in 18 months, will you have a benchmark to know if you're getting a fair deal? Or will you just go back to your current provider?" | Diffuse via future consequence |
| "We use a broker" | "Got it. Did your broker do a structural analysis of your demand profile, or just get you pricing?" | Clarify (show the difference) |
| "We have plenty of time" | "That's actually great timing. Have you started shopping yet? No? Okay — so what happens if you wait until month 11 to start that process?" | Diffuse via consequence |
| "Send me an email" | "Sure, I can do that. But here's the thing — in three weeks you won't remember this call. What if we just grabbed 15 minutes next Tuesday? That way it's fresh on both ends." | Reframe + micro-commitment |

---

## PART SIX: THE TONE & PACING MASTERY (Why Your Delivery Matters More Than Your Words)

### The Three Acoustic Elements That Determine Success

**Element 1: Verbal Pauses**

Most salespeople talk too fast. Fast talk = needy, aggressive, don't trust yourself.

```
❌ Fast: "Hey John we often see hidden charges on your electricity bill 
         and we can show you exactly what's happening with your contract."
         
✅ Slow: "Hey John. Lewis with Nodal Point. I'm pretty sure I'm catching you 
         in the middle of something... Do you have a few seconds?"
         
         [WAIT for "yes"]
         
         "Awesome... So when teams in logistics renew their electricity contracts... 
         we often see hidden charges on their bill. Charges that weren't spoken about... 
         or maybe got sold at a high rate. And they don't even know where the market 
         truly is. Would this sound like something you guys are currently experiencing?"
```

**The pauses force three things:**
1. The prospect has time to THINK (not just react)
2. You sound confident and unhurried (not desperate)
3. The information sinks in (not forgotten in 3 seconds)

**Element 2: Tonality (Downplay Creates Upplay)**

This is the Steve Jobs principle: speak with authority, not urgency.

```
❌ URGENT TONE: "John, I need to show you something CRITICAL about your bill"
   → Prospect feels attacked, puts guard up
   
✅ CALM TONE: "John... I'm probably not going to find anything wrong. 
   Most companies' contracts are actually fine. But just so we're not guessing... 
   should we take 12 minutes and look?"
   → Prospect feels respected, lets guard down
```

When you downplay urgency, the prospect paradoxically upplays interest. They want to prove you're wrong ("Actually, I WANT to look").

**Element 3: Question Mark (Not Period)**

Every sentence that's meant to invite them in should end in curiosity, not certainty.

```
❌ "You probably have demand ratchet issues."
   → Statement. No invitation. Defensive response likely.
   
✅ "Do you think you might have demand ratchet issues?"
   → Question. They have to think. They have to answer.
```

## PART SEVEN: CLOSING THE ADVANCED OBJECTION PATTERN

### The "But" Sequence — When Multiple Objections Happen in Sequence

**This is the pattern:** You handle one objection. They offer another. Then another.

Example:
```
THEM: "We're locked in."
YOU: [Handle it]
THEM: "And we use a broker."
YOU: [Handle it]
THEM: "And we really don't have time."
```

**The Psychology:** Each new objection is the prospect testing your confidence. They're asking, "Are you sure?" If you waffle, they win.

**The Nodal Point Response:**

```
YOU: "Okay, so I hear three things: You're locked in for 18 months, 
     you work with a broker, and time is tight right now. 
     
     I get all of that. And none of it is actually a barrier to what I'm proposing.
     
     Here's why: I'm not asking you to break your contract. 
     I'm not asking you to fire your broker. 
     And I'm not asking you to commit time today.
     
     What I'm asking is this — when you have 15 minutes next week, 
     can we pull up your bill and show you if there's a structural issue? 
     That's it. You get data. You decide what to do with it.
     
     That feel fair?"
```

**Why this works:**
- You grouped the objections (showed you heard them all)
- You reframed each one as not a barrier
- You reset expectations to the simplest ask (just a diagnosis)
- You gave them an out ("you decide what to do with it")

## PART EIGHT: THE FORENSIC FRAMEWORK - How to Position Yourself as an Engineer, Not a Broker

### The Difference in Language

| **Broker Language** | **Engineer Language** |
|---|---|
| "We can save you money" | "Your contract has a structural inefficiency" |
| "Our rates are competitive" | "Your demand ratchet is locked at 80% floor" |
| "We get you the best deal" | "You're paying for reserve margins you don't need" |
| "You need to switch providers" | "Your current contract structure has a design flaw" |
| "We're cheaper than your current deal" | "There's a 23% variance between your usage pattern and your contract terms" |

**The Rule:** Use numbers and technical terms. This converts you from "salesperson" to "analyst."

## PART NINE: THE 7-TOUCH STRATEGY FOR NODAL POINT ENERGY SALES

### How to Stay Top-of-Mind Without Being Creepy

Most sales cycles need 7+ touchpoints before a deal closes. Here's how to structure it:

**Touch 1: The Cold Call (Stage 2: Engagement)**
- Goal: Get agreement for a diagnosis call
- Success: They say "okay, let's talk next Tuesday"

**Touch 2: The Diagnosis Call (Stage 2-4: Full NEPQ Sequence)**
- Goal: Run the structural analysis, show findings
- Success: They say "this is interesting, what's the next step?"

**Touch 3: The Finding Report (Email)**
- Goal: Deliver formal audit results with dollar impact quantified
- Success: They don't ignore it (it's specific to them)

**Touch 4: The Follow-Up Call (Stage 4-5: Transition to Commitment)**
- Goal: Review findings, answer questions, propose solution
- Success: They're open to discussing next steps

**Touch 5: The Proposal (Email + Follow-up)**
- Goal: Present the specific optimization strategy
- Success: They review it seriously (it's not generic)

**Touch 6: The Clarification Call (Handle Objections)**
- Goal: Address concerns, diffuse pricing objections
- Success: They move toward decision

**Touch 7: The Close (Final Commitment)**
- Goal: Get them to sign or commit to timeline
- Success: They say yes or give you a specific date

**The Frequency Pattern:**
```
Touch 1 → 3 days → Touch 2 → 5 days → Touch 3 → 7 days → Touch 4 → 5 days → Touch 5...
```

Space them out. Don't spam. Make each touch valuable.

## PART TEN: WHAT NOT TO DO (Common Mistakes That Kill Deals)

### The Cardinal Sins of Nodal Point Energy Sales

❌ **Sin #1: Pitch Too Early**
```
WRONG: Call and immediately say, "We can save you 8% on your rates"
RIGHT: Ask questions first. Let them discover the problem.
```

❌ **Sin #2: Sound Like Every Other Broker**
```
WRONG: "We're a trusted energy provider with 20 years in the market"
RIGHT: "We identify structural inefficiencies in energy contracts"
```

❌ **Sin #3: Use Discount Tactics to Override Objections**
```
WRONG: "Look, I'll give you an extra 1% if you sign today"
RIGHT: Let the problem speak for itself. Price comes later.
```

❌ **Sin #4: Give Up on "Not Interested"**
```
WRONG: Prospect says "not interested" → You move on
RIGHT: Prospect says "not interested" → You clarify what they mean
```

❌ **Sin #5: Respond to "Send Me an Email" With an Email**
```
WRONG: You send a generic email. It goes to spam. Deal dies.
RIGHT: You resist the deflection. You get a calendar meeting instead.
```

❌ **Sin #6: Fight Multiple Objections at Once**
```
WRONG: "Well, even though you're locked in and use a broker and don't have time..."
RIGHT: One objection at a time. Clarify. Diffuse. Move to next.
```

❌ **Sin #7: Talk About Your Company**
```
WRONG: "We've been in business since 2015 and serve 500+ clients"
RIGHT: "Most of your peers have the same contract structure issue"
```

## CONCLUSION: THE NODAL POINT MINDSET

### You Are Not a Broker. You Are a Market Architect.

Your job is NOT to be cheaper or friendlier or faster than the next guy.

Your job is to **diagnose what everyone else missed** and make them feel stupid for not seeing it themselves.

When you master NEPQ + the commodity psychology in this playbook, you shift from:
- Competing on price → Competing on insight
- Selling a product → Selling a diagnosis
- Losing deals to price shoppers → Converting problem-solvers into clients

**The Final Rule:**

Every time you're tempted to give a discount, give a diagnostic insight instead.

Every time you're tempted to pitch, ask a question instead.

Every time you're tempted to defend, clarify instead.

Do this, and you will never compete on price again.

You will own the market.

## QUICK REFERENCE: THE NEPQ OBJECTION RESPONSE MATRIX

Use this when you're on a call and hit an objection:

| **Objection** | **Your First Move** | **Then Ask** | **Then Diffuse With** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Not interested | Normalize: "That's totally fair" | "When you say not interested, what do you mean?" | Show them future consequences of inaction |
| Locked in | Normalize: "Most people are" | "What's the termination penalty?" | Shift to renewal date: "What happens when you renew?" |
| Use a broker | Validate: "That's smart" | "Did they do a structural audit?" | Show difference between transactional vs diagnostic |
| Have plenty of time | Affirm: "Great timing actually" | "Have you started shopping?" | Plant fear of reactive renewal decision |
| Send email | Agree: "Happy to" | "But when will you actually read it?" | Get a calendar commitment instead |

**Remember:** You are Nodal Point. You break black boxes. You don't compete on commodity. You dominate on architecture.

Now go disrupt the Texas energy market.
