# About Nodal Point
Nodal Point is an advanced energy intelligence platform and procurement partner. We treat energy not as a commodity, but as a volatility market. Our methodology is built on "The Physics of Pricing," focusing on data-driven engineering of client load profiles to mitigate grid-level cost leakages.

# Primary Services & Methodology
- The Physics of Pricing: Algorithmic approach to energy procurement in deregulated markets (ERCOT, PJM, MISO, ISO-NE, NYISO).
- Demand Ratchet Mitigation: Monitoring "Ghost Capacity" to prevent 11-month billing floors.
- 4CP Coincident Peak Prediction: Predictive curtailment to eliminate transmission liabilities.
- Scarcity Pricing Avoidance: Real-time algorithmic grid monitoring to avoid $5,000/MWh spikes.
- Bill Debugger: Forensic analysis of energy invoices to identify hidden costs and optimization opportunities.
