Vector indexes

Once your vector table starts to grow, you will likely want to add an index to speed up queries. Without indexes, you'll be performing a sequential scan which can be a resource-intensive operation when you have many records.

Choosing an index#
Today pgvector supports two types of indexes:

HNSW
IVFFlat
In general we recommend using HNSW because of its performance and robustness against changing data.

Distance operators#
Indexes can be used to improve performance of nearest neighbor search using various distance measures. pgvector includes 3 distance operators:

Operator	Description	Operator class
<->	Euclidean distance	vector_l2_ops
<#>	negative inner product	vector_ip_ops
<=>	cosine distance	vector_cosine_ops
For pgvector versions 0.7.0 and above, it's possible to create indexes on vectors with the following maximum dimensions:

vector: up to 2,000 dimensions
halfvec: up to 4,000 dimensions
bit: up to 64,000 dimensions
You can check your current pgvector version by running: SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector'; or by navigating to the Extensions tab in your Supabase project dashboard.

If you are on an earlier version of pgvector, you should upgrade your project here.
