supabase init
Initialize configurations for Supabase local development.

A supabase/config.toml file is created in your current working directory. This configuration is specific to each local project.

You may override the directory path by specifying the SUPABASE_WORKDIR environment variable or --workdir flag.

In addition to config.toml, the supabase directory may also contain other Supabase objects, such as migrations, functions, tests, etc.

Usage

Flags
--force
Optional
Overwrite existing supabase/config.toml.

-i, --interactive
Optional
Enables interactive mode to configure IDE settings.

Basic usage
Initialize from an existing directory
supabase init
Response
Finished supabase init.
supabase login
Connect the Supabase CLI to your Supabase account by logging in with your personal access token.

Your access token is stored securely in native credentials storage. If native credentials storage is unavailable, it will be written to a plain text file at ~/.supabase/access-token.

If this behavior is not desired, such as in a CI environment, you may skip login by specifying the SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable in other commands.

The Supabase CLI uses the stored token to access Management APIs for projects, functions, secrets, etc.

Usage
supabase login [flags]

supabase link
Link your local development project to a hosted Supabase project.

PostgREST configurations are fetched from the Supabase platform and validated against your local configuration file.

Optionally, database settings can be validated if you provide a password. Your database password is saved in native credentials storage if available.

If you do not want to be prompted for the database password, such as in a CI environment, you may specify it explicitly via the SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD environment variable.

Some commands like db dump, db push, and db pull require your project to be linked first.

supabase gen
Automatically generates type definitions based on your Postgres database schema.

This command connects to your database (local or remote) and generates typed definitions that match your database tables, views, and stored procedures. By default, it generates TypeScript definitions, but also supports Go and Swift.

Generated types give you type safety and autocompletion when working with your database in code, helping prevent runtime errors and improving developer experience.

The types respect relationships, constraints, and custom types defined in your database schema.

Subcommands

supabase db lint
supabase db pull
supabase db push
supabase db reset
supabase db start
supabase db pull
Pulls schema changes from a remote database. A new migration file will be created under supabase/migrations directory.

Requires your local project to be linked to a remote database by running supabase link. For self-hosted databases, you can pass in the connection parameters using --db-url flag.

Note this command requires Docker Desktop (or a running Docker daemon), as it starts a local Postgres container to diff your remote schema.

Optionally, a new row can be inserted into the migration history table to reflect the current state of the remote database.

If no entries exist in the migration history table, pg_dump will be used to capture all contents of the remote schemas you have created. Otherwise, this command will only diff schema changes against the remote database, similar to running db diff --linked.

Usage
supabase db pull [migration name] [flags]
Flags
--db-url <string>
Optional
Pulls from the database specified by the connection string (must be percent-encoded).

--linked
Optional

Finished supabase db pull.
The auth and storage schemas are excluded. Run supabase db pull --schema auth,storage again to diff them.
supabase db push
Pushes all local migrations to a remote database.

Requires your local project to be linked to a remote database by running supabase link. For self-hosted databases, you can pass in the connection parameters using --db-url flag.

The first time this command is run, a migration history table will be created under supabase_migrations.schema_migrations. After successfully applying a migration, a new row will be inserted into the migration history table with timestamp as its unique id. Subsequent pushes will skip migrations that have already been applied.

If you need to mutate the migration history table, such as deleting existing entries or inserting new entries without actually running the migration, use the migration repair command.

Use the --dry-run flag to view the list of changes before applying.

Usage
supabase db push [flags]

supabase db reset
Resets the local database to a clean state.

Requires the local development stack to be started by running supabase start.

Recreates the local Postgres container and applies all local migrations found in supabase/migrations directory. If test data is defined in supabase/seed.sql, it will be seeded after the migrations are run. Any other data or schema changes made during local development will be discarded.

When running db reset with --linked or --db-url flag, a SQL script is executed to identify and drop all user created entities in the remote database. Since Postgres roles are cluster level entities, any custom roles created through the dashboard or supabase/roles.sql will not be deleted by remote reset.

Usage
supabase db reset [flags]
Flags
--db-url <string>
Optional
Resets the database specified by the connection string (must be percent-encoded).

--last <uint>
Optional

Requires your local project to be linked to a remote database by running supabase link. For self-hosted databases, you can pass in the connection parameters using --db-url flag.

Runs pg_dump in a container with additional flags to exclude Supabase managed schemas. The ignored schemas include auth, storage, and those created by extensions.

The default dump does not contain any data or custom roles. To dump those contents explicitly, specify either the --data-only and --role-only flag.

Usage
supabase db dump [flags]
Flags
--data-only
Optional
Dumps only data records.

--db-url <string>
Optional
Dumps from the database specified by the connection string (must be percent-encoded).

supabase db diff
Diffs schema changes made to the local or remote database.

Requires the local development stack to be running when diffing against the local database. To diff against a remote or self-hosted database, specify the --linked or --db-url flag respectively.

Runs djrobstep/migra in a container to compare schema differences between the target database and a shadow database. The shadow database is created by applying migrations in local supabase/migrations directory in a separate container. Output is written to stdout by default. For convenience, you can also save the schema diff as a new migration file by passing in -f flag.

By default, all schemas in the target database are diffed. Use the --schema public,extensions flag to restrict diffing to a subset of schemas.

While the diff command is able to capture most schema changes, there are cases where it is known to fail. Currently, this could happen if your schema contains:

Changes to publication
Changes to storage buckets
Views with security_invoker attributes
Usage
supabase db diff [flags]

supabase db lint
Lints local database for schema errors.

Requires the local development stack to be running when linting against the local database. To lint against a remote or self-hosted database, specify the --linked or --db-url flag respectively.

Runs plpgsql_check extension in the local Postgres container to check for errors in all schemas. The default lint level is warning and can be raised to error via the --level flag.

To lint against specific schemas only, pass in the --schema flag.

The --fail-on flag can be used to control when the command should exit with a non-zero status code. The possible values are:

none (default): Always exit with a zero status code, regardless of lint results.
warning: Exit with a non-zero status code if any warnings or errors are found.
error: Exit with a non-zero status code only if errors are found.
This flag is particularly useful in CI/CD pipelines where you want to fail the build based on certain lint conditions.

supabase migration repair
Repairs the remote migration history table.

Requires your local project to be linked to a remote database by running supabase link.

If your local and remote migration history goes out of sync, you can repair the remote history by marking specific migrations as --status applied or --status reverted. Marking as reverted will delete an existing record from the migration history table while marking as applied will insert a new record.

For example, your migration history may look like the table below, with missing entries in either local or remote.

$ supabase migration list
        LOCAL      │     REMOTE     │     TIME (UTC)
  ─────────────────┼────────────────┼──────────────────────
                   │ 20230103054303 │ 2023-01-03 05:43:03
   20230103054315  │                │ 2023-01-03 05:43:15
To reset your migration history to a clean state, first delete your local migration file.

$ rm supabase/migrations/20230103054315_remote_commit.sql

$ supabase migration list
        LOCAL      │     REMOTE     │     TIME (UTC)

supabase migration squash
Squashes local schema migrations to a single migration file.

The squashed migration is equivalent to a schema only dump of the local database after applying existing migration files. This is especially useful when you want to remove repeated modifications of the same schema from your migration history.

However, one limitation is that data manipulation statements, such as insert, update, or delete, are omitted from the squashed migration. You will have to add them back manually in a new migration file. This includes cron jobs, storage buckets, and any encrypted secrets in vault.

By default, the latest <timestamp>_<name>.sql file will be updated to contain the squashed migration. You can override the target version using the --version <timestamp> flag.

If your supabase/migrations directory is empty, running supabase squash will do nothing.

Usage
supabase migration squash [flags]

supabase inspect db bloat
This command displays an estimation of table "bloat" - Due to Postgres' MVCC when data is updated or deleted new rows are created and old rows are made invisible and marked as "dead tuples". Usually the autovacuum process will asynchronously clean the dead tuples. Sometimes the autovacuum is unable to work fast enough to reduce or prevent tables from becoming bloated. High bloat can slow down queries, cause excessive IOPS and waste space in your database.

Tables with a high bloat ratio should be investigated to see if vacuuming is not quick enough or if there are other issues.

supabase inspect db locks
This command displays queries that have taken out an exclusive lock on a relation. Exclusive locks typically prevent other operations on that relation from taking place, and can be a cause of "hung" queries that are waiting for a lock to be granted.

If you see a query that is hanging for a very long time or causing blocking issues you may consider killing the query by connecting to the database and running SELECT pg_cancel_backend(PID); to cancel the query. If the query still does not stop you can force a hard stop by running SELECT pg_terminate_backend(PID);

     PID   │ RELNAME │ TRANSACTION ID │ GRANTED │                  QUERY                  │   AGE

supabase inspect db outliers
This command displays statements, obtained from pg_stat_statements, ordered by the amount of time to execute in aggregate. This includes the statement itself, the total execution time for that statement, the proportion of total execution time for all statements that statement has taken up, the number of times that statement has been called, and the amount of time that statement spent on synchronous I/O (reading/writing from the file system).

Typically, an efficient query will have an appropriate ratio of calls to total execution time, with as little time spent on I/O as possible. Queries that have a high total execution time but low call count should be investigated to improve their performance. Queries that have a high proportion of execution time being spent on synchronous I/O should also be investigated.


                 QUERY                   │ EXECUTION TIME   │ PROPORTION OF EXEC TIME │ NUMBER CALLS │ SYNC IO TIME

supabase inspect db replication-slots
This command shows information about logical replication slots that are setup on the database. It shows if the slot is active, the state of the WAL sender process ('startup', 'catchup', 'streaming', 'backup', 'stopping') the replication client address and the replication lag in GB.

This command is useful to check that the amount of replication lag is as low as possible, replication lag can occur due to network latency issues, slow disk I/O, long running transactions or lack of ability for the subscriber to consume WAL fast enough.

supabase inspect db traffic-profile
This command analyzes table I/O patterns to show read/write activity ratios based on block-level operations. It combines data from PostgreSQL's pg_stat_user_tables (for tuple operations) and pg_statio_user_tables (for block I/O) to categorize each table's workload profile.

The command classifies tables into categories:

Read-Heavy - Read operations are more than 5x write operations (e.g., 1:10, 1:50)
Write-Heavy - Write operations are more than 20% of read operations (e.g., 1:2, 1:4, 2:1, 10:1)
Balanced - Mixed workload where writes are between 20% and 500% of reads
Read-Only - Only read operations detected
Write-Only - Only write operations detected
SCHEMA │ TABLE        │ BLOCKS READ │ WRITE TUPLES │ BLOCKS WRITE │ ACTIVITY RATIO
───────┼──────────────┼─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼────────────────────
public │ user_events  │     450,234 │     9,004,680│       23,450 │ 20:1 (Write-Heavy)
public │ users        │      89,203 │        12,451│        1,203 │ 7.2:1 (Read-Heavy)
public │ sessions     │      15,402 │        14,823│        2,341 │ ≈1:1 (Balanced)
public │ cache_data   │     123,456 │             0│            0 │ Read-Only
auth   │ audit_logs   │           0 │        98,234│       12,341 │ Write-Only
Note: This command only displays tables that have had both read and write activity. Tables with no I/O operations are not shown. The classification ratio threshold (default: 5:1) determines when a table is considered "heavy" in one direction versus balanced.

supabase inspect db vacuum-stats
This shows you stats about the vacuum activities for each table. Due to Postgres' MVCC when data is updated or deleted new rows are created and old rows are made invisible and marked as "dead tuples". Usually the autovacuum process will asynchronously clean the dead tuples.

The command lists when the last vacuum and last auto vacuum took place, the row count on the table as well as the count of dead rows and whether autovacuum is expected to run or not. If the number of dead rows is much higher than the row count, or if an autovacuum is expected but has not been performed for some time, this can indicate that autovacuum is not able to keep up and that your vacuum settings need to be tweaked or that you require more compute or disk IOPS to allow autovacuum to complete.

        SCHEMA        │              TABLE               │ LAST VACUUM │ LAST AUTO VACUUM │      ROW COUNT       │ DEAD ROW COUNT │ EXPECT AUTOVACUUM?

supabase functions
Manage Supabase Edge Functions.

Supabase Edge Functions are server-less functions that run close to your users.

Edge Functions allow you to execute custom server-side code without deploying or scaling a traditional server. They're ideal for handling webhooks, custom API endpoints, data validation, and serving personalized content.

Edge Functions are written in TypeScript and run on Deno compatible edge runtime, which is a secure runtime with no package management needed, fast cold starts, and built-in security.

Subcommands
supabase functions delete
supabase functions deploy
supabase functions download
supabase functions list
supabase functions new
supabase functions serve
supabase functions new
Creates a new Edge Function with boilerplate code in the supabase/functions directory.

This command generates a starter TypeScript file with the necessary Deno imports and a basic function structure. The function is created as a new directory with the name you specify, containing an index.ts file with the function code.

After creating the function, you can edit it locally and then use supabase functions serve to test it before deploying with supabase functions deploy.

Usage
supabase functions new <Function name>
supabase functions list
List all Functions in the linked Supabase project.

Usage
supabase functions list [flags]
Flags
--project-ref <string>
Optional
Project ref of the Supabase project.

supabase functions download
Download the source code for a Function from the linked Supabase project.

Usage
supabase functions download <Function name> [flags]
Flags
--project-ref <string>
Optional
Project ref of the Supabase project.

--use-api
Optional
Unbundle functions server-side without using Docker.

supabase functions serve
Serve all Functions locally.

supabase functions serve command includes additional flags to assist developers in debugging Edge Functions via the v8 inspector protocol, allowing for debugging via Chrome DevTools, VS Code, and IntelliJ IDEA for example. Refer to the docs guide for setup instructions.

--inspect

Alias of --inspect-mode brk.
--inspect-mode [ run | brk | wait ]

Activates the inspector capability.
run mode simply allows a connection without additional behavior. It is not ideal for short scripts, but it can be useful for long-running scripts where you might occasionally want to set breakpoints.
brk mode same as run mode, but additionally sets a breakpoint at the first line to pause script execution before any code runs.
wait mode similar to brk mode, but instead of setting a breakpoint at the first line, it pauses script execution until an inspector session is connected.
--inspect-main

Can only be used when one of the above two flags is enabled.
By default, creating an inspector session for the main worker is not allowed, but this flag allows it.
Other behaviors follow the inspect-mode flag mentioned above.
Additionally, the following properties can be customized via supabase/config.toml under edge_runtime section.

inspector_port
The port used to listen to the Inspector session, defaults to 8083.
policy
A value that indicates how the edge-runtime should forward incoming HTTP requests to the worker.
per_worker allows multiple HTTP requests to be forwarded to a worker that has already been created.
oneshot will force the worker to process a single HTTP request and then exit. (Debugging purpose, This is especially useful if you want to reflect changes you've made immediately.)
Usage
