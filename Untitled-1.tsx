okay now for the final and most crucial step. I want to click the top "scripts" icon to the left of the bell icon in the top bar, and i want it to open up this cold calling script. I want the script to auto populate all the fields with applicable fields already in my firebase/crm code.Auto populate the cold calling script with all the text needed to complete the script with all known values. if value is unknown, then just leave blank. I want all known values in the energy health check widget to autopopulate with values from my database in firebase/crm. If all values are known, then i want the page to load with the health check report already ran. When You run an energy health check, i want the fiedls in the existing accounts fields to update simultaneously to the associated account. the associated account for the energy health check will come from the company name and in the cold calling script fields above. that way its all cohesive. when i hit the save note button at the bottom, i want it to save the details in the cold calling script as well to the firebase database/crm code at the same time.  when i hit the save button, i want it to tell me that the Note has been added and the prospects contact details have been updated. when a report is ran, i want a notification telling me that the account details have been updated. I want all fields in the energy health check and script to match with all the fields in the contacts and accounts in my existing CRM. Can you add this cold calling script into the full crm without changing a single thing about the contents <script> at all. i want to maintain the full cold calling script and energy health check functionality. maintain all widgets in the right hand side.calling tips, news, objectinos, ect. all the same.this page should fit in the content area of the page. the page has a top bar and left panel that has the rest of the pages. give this the themes and colors of my current page but full functionality. the home screen dashboard is a perfect example of how the page should behave. the left hand side widget should scroll under the top bar. the layout of the main crm dashboard page is perfect. the two town design is nice. the background is lighter where the widget is compared to the dark background where the main content section is. i love this. I want to make this transition adding this page as easy as possible. can you first generate the full html file required to embed on my website? i do not want a full html with everything, the file will be too big. I just need an updated. index.html file for the additions we are making.
