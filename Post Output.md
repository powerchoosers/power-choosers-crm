Last November, EIA forecasted Henry Hub natural gas at $3.90/MMBtu for this winter. This December STEO, it's $4.30/MMBtu, up more than 40 cents. Here's what changed.[2][5]

Commercial energy buyers nationwide will learn how colder December weather, data center demand, and shifting generation forecasts impact procurement decisions through 2026. I'll break down the key STEO revisions and their effects on **capacity charges** in markets like PJM and ISO-NE.

## EIA December STEO Key Revisions for Commercial Buyers 2026

## Henry Hub Spot Prices Jump $4.30/MMBtu Winter Average
Cold snap in December drove EIA to raise Q4 2025 Henry Hub forecast by 36 cents to $3.87/MMBtu and Q1 2026 by 37 cents to $4.35/MMBtu.[1]
Residential and commercial sectors now face 6% higher natural gas use in December, pulling inventories down faster at 580 Bcf withdrawals—28% above five-year average.[1]
Prices moderate to $4.00/MMBtu annual average in 2026 with milder early-year weather and rising production.[2]

## Electricity Generation Grows 2.4% in 2025, 1.7% in 2026
U.S. power sector generation rises 2.4% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026, driven by data centers in PJM (3.3% demand growth both years) and other regions.[2][6]
Revised down from prior month due to actual large-load connections this year; natural gas generation holds steady with 2% growth in key markets.[6]
This lifts wholesale prices, pushing **capacity charges** to $5-$8 per kW ranges in PJM and ISO-NE for 2026 auctions.[2]

## Coal Consumption Surges 9% Before Renewables Take Over
Coal use jumps 9% in 2025 on 11% electric power sector increase from higher nat gas costs and demand; falls in 2026 as renewables grow.[2][5]
Expect natural gas generation dip 4% in 2025 then +2% in 2026 amid solar displacement.[3]
Commercial buyers see fuel mix volatility feeding into higher pass-through costs nationwide.[5]

## Analyst Insight
For businesses with stable loads, I recommend **fixed-price contracts** locking through Q2 2026. If your operations have high load factor above 60%, consider index-linked plans to capture post-winter price moderation forecasted at $4.00/MMBtu. This hedges against winter peaks while positioning for 1.7% generation growth pressures in PJM and MISO.

## Conclusion
EIA's December STEO signals upward pressure on natural gas and capacity charges through winter 2025-2026, but moderation ahead offers procurement windows. Businesses acting on these forecasts—balancing fixed certainty against index flexibility—gain competitive edge amid 2.4% generation growth. Review your exposure before Q1 auctions heat up.
