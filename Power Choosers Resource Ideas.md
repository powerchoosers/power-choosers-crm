## 🚧 PLANNED TOOLS (Not Yet Implemented)

### 2. The "Delivery Charge Estimator" (Planned)
**The Pain Point:** Capacity charges (in PJM, ISO-NE, NYISO) or Demand charges (in ERCOT) are retrospective. Businesses don't know what they will pay next year until it's too late.
**The Tool:** A simple calculator that estimates their future capacity obligation.
**Inputs:**
- Independent System Operator (ISO): Dropdown (ERCOT, PJM, etc.)
- Highest Summer Demand (kW): User enters their peak from a bill.
- Current Capacity Rate ($/kW-day): You provide a default average or let them edit it.
**Output:**
- "Your estimated Capacity Tag is **250 kW**."
- "You are at risk of paying **$18,000** in capacity charges next year."
- **Call to Action:** "Want to lower this? Schedule a Peak Load Management review."

### 3. The "Fixed vs. Index" Risk Assessment (Planned)
**The Pain Point:** "Should I lock in a rate or float with the market?"
**The Tool:** A quiz-style assessment.
**Inputs:**
- "Can you shift production schedules on 2-hour notice?" (Yes/No)
- "Is budget certainty your #1 priority?" (Yes/No)
- "What represents a larger risk: Overpaying by 10% or budget volatility?"
**Output:**
- **"You are a Conservative Buyer."** Recommendation: 100% Fixed Contract.
- **"You are an Aggressive Buyer."** Recommendation: Block & Index Strategy.

### 4. Commercial "Price to Compare" Checker (Planned)
**The Pain Point:** "Am I paying too much right now?"
**The Tool:** A live table comparing Utility "Price to Compare" (PTC) vs. Current Market Rates.
**Data Source:** You manually update this weekly or scrape utility tariffs.
**Display:**
| Utility | Utility Rate (PTC) | Market Rate Estimate | Potential Savings |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Oncor (ERCOT) | 8.5¢ / kWh | 5.2¢ / kWh | **38%** |
| ComEd (PJM) | 7.1¢ / kWh | 6.8¢ / kWh | **4%** |
**Call to Action:** "Get a custom quote to lock in these savings."

### 5. The "Power Penalty" Calculator (Bandwidth Usage) (Planned)
**The Pain Point:** Swing/Bandwidth clauses. If a factory uses too little or too much power, suppliers penalize them.
**The Tool:** Calculates potential usage penalties.
**Inputs:**
- Contracted Annual Usage (kWh): e.g., 1,000,000
- Actual Usage (kWh): e.g., 800,000 (20% drop)
- Swing Tolerance: Dropdown (10%, 25%, 100%)
**Output:**
- "You are **outside your bandwidth** by 100,000 kWh."
- "Estimated Penalty: **$4,200** (based on market liquidation rates)."

### 6. Contract Expiration & Renewal Monitor (Planned)
**The Pain Point:** "I forgot my contract expired and rolled onto a variable rate."
**The Tool:** A simple email reminder service.
**Inputs:**
- Current Supplier
- Contract End Date
- Email Address
**Value:** "We will email you 6 months, 3 months, and 1 month before your contract ends with a competitive benchmark report."
