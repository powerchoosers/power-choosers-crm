The Texas energy market is not a commodity market; it is a volatility market. I do not "procure electricity" or "shop for rates." I serve as a forensic engineer for institutional load profiles, decoupling commercial liability from grid scarcity.

We reject the standard brokerage model that treats energy as a fixed operational expense. Instead, I lead the Forensic Audit Protocol, reverse-engineering supplier tariffs to identify and eliminate structural cost leakage hidden in the "pass-through" mechanisms of the ERCOT grid.

THE ARCHITECTURE:

// Forensic Rate Engineering Executing deep-level audits of historical interval data to detect variances between Metered Demand and Billed Demand. I identify inefficiencies where clients pay for capacity they do not use due to 80% Demand Ratchets ("Ghost Capacity").

// 4CP Coincident Peak Defense Designing algorithmic load-shedding strategies to predict and mitigate liability during the four critical summer intervals (June–Sept). This "deletes" transmission cost liability for the subsequent calendar year rather than simply paying the invoice.

// Volatility Architecture Structuring contracts as financial derivatives rather than subscriptions. I hedge client P&L against Scarcity Pricing Adders and Operating Reserve Demand Curve (ORDC) spikes that drive wholesale costs to $5,000/MWh.

// Structural Decoupling Moving clients off "blind" fixed rates that include heavy volatility premiums and onto engineered products that isolate the signal (Energy) from the noise (Ancillary Services, TDU Charges, and Taxes).

MANDATE: We do not guess. We measure. Signal Over Noise.The Texas energy market is not a commodity market; it is a volatility market. I do not "procure electricity" or "shop for rates."
