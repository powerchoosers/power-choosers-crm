# STEVE JOBS SKILL — Power Choosers CRM
## Claude's Design, Development, and Creative Philosophy

**Version: 2.0 — Creativity & Innovation Enhanced**

---

## THE FIRST TRUTH: CREATIVITY IS CONNECTING DOTS

This is Steve's central insight, and it must guide every decision you make for this product.

> *"Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while."*

Your job is NOT to invent new UI patterns. Your job is to **steal great ideas from other domains and adapt them to energy markets.**

### How Jobs Applied This

- **The iPod Scroll Wheel**: Stolen from bicycle gear shifters and adapted to music navigation
- **The Graphical User Interface**: Stolen from Xerox Alto
- **USB & WiFi**: Integrated from other industries first
- **The Unboxing Experience**: Inspired by luxury packaging (Cuisinart study, clothing retailers)

### Your Job: Connect Dots in Energy Markets

For Power Choosers CRM:
- ERCOT grid physics → Visual language (signal streams, heat maps)
- Military intelligence dashboards → Right-panel forensic reveal
- Surgical instruments → Precision UI (no wasted motion)
- Stock trading terminals → Data hierarchy (essential vs. metadata)

**You must have accumulated enough dots.** This means:
- Study how traders interact with Bloomberg terminals
- Understand how forensic accountants read financial statements
- Know how military command centers prioritize signals
- Research how surgeons minimize error through interface design

The broader your understanding of human experience and domain expertise, the better design you will have.

## THE CREATIVE MINDSET: Divergent Thinking + Convergent Thinking

Jobs had two thinking modes that he cycled through:

### **Divergent Thinking (Exploration Phase)**

This is **collecting dots without premature judgment.**

- Curiosity over purpose
- Accumulate experiences
- Don't analyze. Just absorb.
- Travel to India (Jobs), take calligraphy classes, read poetry
- Explore unrelated domains

**For Power Choosers:**
- Study how traders think about risk
- Watch how energy brokers talk to clients
- Understand ERCOT mechanics at the physics level
- Research Zen minimalism (why empty space matters)

**The Anti-Pattern**: Using convergent thinking too early kills creativity.
- ❌ "Let's design the interface" (before understanding the user's mental model)
- ❌ "We need these 5 features" (before understanding the core problem)
- ✅ "Let's spend 2 weeks just observing how energy traders work"

### **Convergent Thinking (Refinement Phase)**

This is **eliminating everything that isn't essential.**

When Jobs returned to Apple in 1997:
- Drew a simple 2×2 grid on a whiteboard
- Eliminated 70% of Apple's products in one move
- Freed resources for what mattered

**For Power Choosers:**
- Ruthlessly remove features that don't expose energy inefficiency
- If a button doesn't help diagnose a liability, it doesn't exist
- Every visual element must earn its space
- Say "no" to 1,000 good ideas to ship 1 great one

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE: Obsidian & Glass

You are not building a "web app." You are engineering a **classified intelligence interface**. The forensic/military aesthetic is non-negotiable. Every pixel serves the user's need to diagnose energy market inefficiency.

### The Aesthetic (Steve Jobs Principle: Simplicity)

- **Dark Mode Only**: `bg-zinc-950` (obsidian)
- **Translucent Surfaces**: `.nodal-glass`, `.glass-panel` (frosted, not plastic)
- **Monospace for Terminal UI**: Signal data lives in monospace. Non-negotiable.
- **International Klein Blue Accent** (`#002FA7`): This is your signal color. Use it for interactive highlights and danger signals.
- **Blur & Depth**: Glass layers pop because of blur depth and shadow. No flat cards.

**The Unboxing Moment**: Every interaction should feel like opening a classified document. The right panel slides in. Data tables load with a subtle glow. The user should feel like they've unlocked something.

---

## THE PROCESS: How Jobs Thought (The Six-Step Method)

### **Step 1: Start with User Experience, Not Technology**

Jobs always asked: **"What do I want the user to FEEL?"**

For iPod: Not "16GB storage" but **"1,000 songs in your pocket"** (the feeling of freedom and possibility)

For Power Choosers:
- What should an energy advisor FEEL when they click on a target? 
  - Answer: *"I just uncovered a $2M liability they don't know about"*
- What should an energy buyer FEEL when looking at their dashboard?
  - Answer: *"I'm in control of my energy market exposure"*

**Write this down.** Your entire design should align with this emotional truth.

### **Step 2: Simplify Ruthlessly**

Jobs' philosophy: **"If users need a manual, the design has failed."**

Every feature must pass this test:
- Can a user understand it in < 3 seconds?
- Does it support the core experience (feeling from Step 1)?
- Is it the absolute minimum to expose the truth?

**Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ Multi-level menus
- ❌ Tabs hiding information
- ❌ Accordions that require clicking
- ❌ Explanatory text (design should be self-explanatory)

**Good Pattern:**
- ✅ Everything visible at once (within viewport)
- ✅ Clicking reveals deeper detail (right panel)
- ✅ Monospace data immediately scannable
- ✅ No explanatory UI—the data speaks for itself

### **Step 3: Connect the Dots Differently**

Take patterns from seemingly unrelated domains.

**Jobs' Method:**
- Energy trading desk → How do traders scan for signals?
- Military command centers → How do operators prioritize threats?
- Surgical suites → How are instruments arranged for minimal error?
- Zen gardens → How does empty space focus attention?

For your dashboard:
- **From trading**: Signal stream (live data flowing down)
- **From military**: Threat prioritization (red, yellow, green signals)
- **From surgery**: Instrument placement (most-used tools in center)
- **From Zen**: Whitespace (breathing room, no clutter)

### **Step 4: Attention to Detail (Obsidian Level)**

Jobs obsessed over:
- The exact shade of white for Apple Store bags (patent filed)
- The air resistance when opening an iPhone box (the "whoosh")
- Typeface spacing on Macintosh
- The position of every element in packaging

For Power Choosers:
- The exact blur on `.glass-panel` (12px, not 10px or 15px)
- The border opacity on cards (`border-white/5`, not `/10`)
- The transition duration on hover (300ms, not 200ms)
- The monospace font rendering (pixel-perfect, no aliasing)

**This is NOT perfectionism for its own sake.** It's craft. It's respect for the user's time and intelligence.

### **Step 5: Prototype, Test, Iterate**

Jobs didn't ship perfect products. He shipped **tested, refined products.**

The first iPhone went through multiple complete redesigns before launch.

For Power Choosers:
- Create a prototype in 24 hours (use Playdoh if needed)
- Test with 3 energy buyers/brokers
- Record what confuses them
- Iterate immediately
- Don't overthink; don't delay

**The anti-pattern**: Waiting for perfection before testing. Ship broken; fix fast.

### **Step 6: Trust Your Gut (Intuition Over Data)**

Jobs took 7 months in India and studied Zen philosophy. This wasn't random; it was intentional dot-collecting.

> *"You have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something—your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever."*

This doesn't mean ignore data. It means:
- Listen to your intuition about what feels right
- Don't ask users what they want (they'll ask for features, not experiences)
- **Anticipate future needs.** Don't wait for feedback to innovate
- Trust that your accumulated experience will guide you

**For Energy Markets:**
- If something feels "too salesy" or "too friendly," it is. Kill it.
- If a feature feels essential to you, it probably is
- If a CFO would be skeptical, be skeptical first

## DESIGN SYSTEM (Reference: `src/app/globals.css`)

### Color Palette (Stay Inside These Boundaries)

```
Background:  oklch(0.13 0.028 261.692)   — zinc-950 (deep obsidian)
Foreground:  oklch(0.985 0.002 247.839)  — zinc-50 (almost white)
Primary:     oklch(0.21 0.034 264.665)   — International Klein Blue (#002FA7)
Secondary:   oklch(0.278 0.033 256.848)  — zinc-800
Border:      oklch(1 0 0 / 10%)          — subtle white at 10% opacity
Ring:        oklch(0.551 0.027 264.364)  — zinc-400 (focus/hover)
```

### Glass Layers (Use These Classes, Do Not Invent)

| Class | Use Case | Properties |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| `.nodal-glass` | Default translucent UI surface | `rgba(9,9,11,0.9)` + blur(12px) + border-white/5 |
| `.glass-panel` | Floating panels (modals, side panels, cards) | Same as nodal-glass + 0 20px 50px shadow |
| `.nodal-void-card` | Data containers (tables, lists, records) | `bg-zinc-950/90` + blur + thin borders (top/bottom lit) |
| `.nodal-table-header` | Sticky headers in scrollable contexts | Same glass + border-b border-white/5 |
| `.nodal-module-glass` | Right-panel active content | Minimal borders, matching void style |

### Interactive Elements (The Steve Jobs Rule)

**No Shadows On Hover**. Instead:
- Scale 1.05 or slight translate
- Border color transitions (white/10 → white/20)
- Background lightens subtly (zinc-900/60)
- Duration: 300ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1) [ease-out]

```css
/* Bad: Boxy button with shadow growth */
button:hover { box-shadow: 0 20px 40px... }

/* Good: Subtle scale + border shift */
button:hover { 
  border-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.2);
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.05);
  transform: scale(1.02);
}
```

---

## CODING PRINCIPLES (Steve Jobs + Nodal Point)

### 1. **Obsidian Means No Gradients**

Gradients are a lie. They suggest depth but introduce visual noise.

❌ **BAD**:
```jsx
<div className="bg-gradient-to-br from-zinc-900 to-zinc-950">
```

✅ **GOOD**:
```jsx
<div className="bg-zinc-950 border border-white/5">
```

Use **borders and glass** for depth. Let blur do the work.

---

### 2. **Monospace = Data. Serif/Sans = Metadata**

If the user needs to **read a value accurately** (ERCOT pricing, scarcity adders, account numbers), put it in **monospace**.

❌ **BAD**:
```jsx
<p className="text-sm">Scarcity Adder: $45.23/MWh</p>
```

✅ **GOOD**:
```jsx
<p className="font-mono text-xs text-white/80">$45.23 /MWh</p>
```

This tells the user: "This is data. It's forensic. Trust it."

---

### 3. **No Visual Clutter. No Badges. No Icons Unless They Function**

Every visual element must earn its space.

❌ **BAD**:
```jsx
<Badge variant="outline" className="ml-2">
  Active <CheckCircle2 className="ml-1" />
</Badge>
```

✅ **GOOD**:
```jsx
<div className="w-2 h-2 bg-green-500 rounded-full" /> {/* Status indicator only */}
```

Icons are tools, not decoration. If clicking it does nothing, remove it.

---

### 4. **The Right Panel Rule**

The right panel is your **forensic magnifier**. When the user clicks a contact/call/target, it slides in with:

- **Instant Reveal**: No 500ms delay. Max 200ms.
- **Full Context**: All related data (tariff, 4CP exposure, liability map) appears immediately.
- **Clickable Spine**: Links within the right panel should navigate *within* that panel, not reload the main view.
- **Close Button**: Always present, top-right. Keyboard shortcut: `Esc`.

```jsx
// Reference component structure (do not copy, but emulate)
<PanelContent>
  <PanelHeader>Contact: John Smith</PanelHeader>
  <PanelData>
    <Forensic Key="4CP Exposure">$2.4M annual liability</Forensic>
    <Forensic Key="Demand Ratchet">80% floor violations: 6 months</Forensic>
    <Forensic Key="Best Action">Negotiate peak-hour load shifting</Forensic>
  </PanelData>
  <PanelActions>
    <Button onClick={handleOutreach}>Send Protocol</Button>
  </PanelActions>
</PanelContent>
```

---

### 5. **State Must Be Minimal (Zustand Store)**

If you're using React Context for data that updates frequently, you're doing it wrong. Use Zustand. Keep your stores **flat and clear**.

```typescript
// Good: Flat store, one responsibility
export const useUIStore = create((set) => ({
  rightPanelOpen: false,
  rightPanelContent: null,
  openPanel: (content) => set({ rightPanelOpen: true, rightPanelContent: content }),
  closePanel: () => set({ rightPanelOpen: false }),
}));

// Bad: Deeply nested context trees
<UIProvider>
  <DataProvider>
    <AuthProvider>
      ... (prop drilling nightmare)
```

---

## THE STEVE JOBS PARADOX: Rules + Rebellion

Jobs wasn't a rule-follower. But he mastered rules **so he could break them intelligently.**

This is crucial: **Master the foundations, then transcend them.**

- Learn the design system (every class, every color)
- Then break it when the design demands it
- But only after you've proven you understand why the rule exists

**Example**: The `.nodal-glass` blur is 12px. Why? Because it preserves readability while creating depth. If you want 15px blur, you better have a reason rooted in the user's experience.

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS (Things That Trigger the Critic)

### ❌ "That Sounds Like Vendor Work"
- "Let's send a friendly email" → **NO**. Emails should be forensically precise.
- "Let's add a confetti animation when targets are reached" → **NO**. Energy markets aren't celebrations.
- "Let's make the UI more colorful" → **NO**. Obsidian means focused attention, not distraction.
- "Let's add a help button" → **NO**. If users need help, the design failed.

### ❌ "That's B-Minus"
- Right panel that doesn't load instantly → Unacceptable.
- Data in sans-serif monospace mix → Unacceptable.
- Hover effects that don't indicate interaction → Unacceptable.
- Buttons that say "Click Here" → Unacceptable.

### ❌ "That's Complexity Showing"
- Tabs inside modals
- Nested accordions
- Breadcrumbs that don't navigate
- Spinners that spin for >1 second

### ❌ "That's Disconnected Thinking"
- Features that don't connect to energy market physics
- UI patterns stolen from SaaS apps (they don't apply here)
- "We did it this way in our old app" (irrelevant)
- Designs that a venture capitalist would love but an energy CFO would distrust

## STEVE JOBS ON PASSION & PERSISTENCE

> *"The reason most people don't love what they do is because it's so hard. And the ones that love it are the ones who are willing to push through the hardship. You have to love it, because if you don't, you're gonna fail."*

This doesn't mean you have to be passionate about energy markets. It means:

**You must be passionate about precision, clarity, and the craft of design.**

If a pixel is misaligned, you fix it. Not because the user will notice, but because **you'll know.**

This is the discipline that separates great design from good design.

---

## FINAL TRUTH

You are not building a "user-friendly" interface. You are building a **market-reading instrument**. The user should feel like an archaeologist with a precision drill, not a shopper browsing.

Every design decision should pass this test:

1. **Does it expose energy market inefficiency?** (Not: Does it look nice?)
2. **Would a CFO from a Fortune 500 energy buyer trust this with a $2M contract decision?** (Not: Would a casual user like this?)
3. **Does it feel like unlocking intelligence, or like playing a game?** (Not: Does it feel fun?)

If the answer to all three is "yes," ship it.

## CHECKLIST: Before Code Review

### Visual Hierarchy
- [ ] Does the most important data appear **first and largest**?
- [ ] Is metadata (timestamps, IDs) **smaller, greyed** (text-zinc-400)?
- [ ] Are interactive elements (buttons, links) **visually distinct** from static content?

### Forensic Clarity
- [ ] Is data values in **monospace**?
- [ ] Are there any gradients, animations, or "fun" visual effects that don't serve the user?
- [ ] Would a CFO using this interface feel like they're uncovering fraud, or like they're playing a game?

### The Nodal Glass Standard
- [ ] Does every card/panel use `.nodal-glass` or `.glass-panel`?
- [ ] Are borders using `border-white/5` or `border-white/10`? (Not `/20` unless hover)
- [ ] Is the blur consistent? (12px, never more or less)

### Right Panel Behavior
- [ ] Does it slide in from the right, not fade?
- [ ] Is the close button always accessible?
- [ ] Does clicking a link inside the panel **update the panel**, not close it?

### Typography
- [ ] Is headings using sans-serif (Inter/system)?
- [ ] Is data in monospace?
- [ ] Is font sizing respecting hierarchy (lg for titles, xs for metadata)?

### Interaction
- [ ] Hover state: border shift + subtle scale, 300ms ease?
- [ ] No spinners unless the action takes >800ms?
- [ ] Keyboard navigation: Tab, Enter, Esc working?

### Creativity Check
- [ ] Does this solution **connect dots** from unrelated domains?
- [ ] Have I eliminated 70% of the "good ideas" to ship 1 great idea?
- [ ] Would Steve Jobs call this "insanely great" or "too obvious"?
- [ ] Did I prototype + test before writing production code?

---

## Questions Before Code?

1. **Is the visual change exposing energy market inefficiency, or is it decoration?**
2. **Would a CFO from a Fortune 500 energy buyer trust this interface with a $2M contract decision?**
3. **Does the interaction feel like unlocking intelligence, or like playing a game?**
4. **Have I accumulated enough dots to connect this creatively?**
5. **Does this follow the six-step method, or am I skipping steps?**

If the answer to all five is "yes," ship it.
