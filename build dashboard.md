Nodal Point // Operational Velocity & Call HUD Expansion🎯 Executive SummaryTransitioning the primary dashboard from passive market-price tracking to active Operational Velocity. The goal is to replace the RESPONSE_PHYSICS graph with a Dial Quota Engine and expand the active call bar to eliminate "dead space" on high-resolution displays.1. Primary KPI: The 100-Dial Quota EngineObjective: Replace the placeholder line graph with a real-time tracking system for your daily 100-dial intervention quota.Visual ArchitectureComponent: Velocity_Tracker_v3Layout: High-density horizontal layout replacing the current chart area.The Core Metric: Large font-mono tabular-nums display showing CURRENT_DIALS / 100.The Velocity Bar:A custom nodal-glass progress bar container.Visual Logic: - 0-33 Dials: Zinc-500 (Cold).34-66 Dials: Klein Blue (#002FA7) (Tracing).67-100 Dials: Emerald-500 Glow (Locked).Sub-Metrics (Forensic Breakdown):Connect Rate: % of dials that reached a human.Signal Efficiency: % of connects that moved to "Interest."Asset Capture: Total bills uploaded during this session.2. HUD Expansion: The Full-Width Call InterfaceObjective: Eliminate the awkward empty space on larger screens and align the active call display with the Global Search bar's width.Design EvolutionWidth Rule: Expand max-w to match the search bar (approx. 800px - 1000px).Left Sector (Identity): - Keep the existing icon-circle and Entity Name.Add a "Node Status" tag next to the name (e.g., [RISK_NODE]).Center Sector (Dynamics):Move the 04:22 timer to the center of the bar to anchor the visual.Add a live audio waveform visualizer (zinc-700) to signify "Neural Link Active."Right Sector (Intervention Triggers):Connect: Toggle state (turns Klein Blue when selected).Interest: Toggle state (turns Amber when signal detected).Lock: Toggle state (turns Emerald when diagnostic confirmed).Hangup: The "Rose" end-call button as the terminal point.3. Data Integration (Eliminating Placeholders)Objective: Replace all mock metrics with actual values from the Nodal Point database.Source MappingTotal Revenue: Pull from accounts.estimatedRevenue (SUM).Active Calls: Real-time state from callStore.Handshake Resolution: - Fetch from search_interactions using a filter for "Today's Date."Aggregate count by outcome (Connect, Interest, Voicemail).Signal Feed: Live RSS stream filtered for "ERCOT" and "Grid Volatility."4. Design Guidelines for Gemini 3.1 ProWhen prompting the model to execute this, use the following context locks:Aesthetic: Obsidian & Glass (frosted, high blur, 1px white/10 borders).Typography: Inter for prose; JetBrains Mono for tabular data/KPIs.Animations: Use framer-motion for the progress bar filling and the call-bar expansion.Responsiveness: Use md:flex-row and w-full logic to ensure the call bar scales perfectly from a laptop screen to a 4K trading monitor.Implementation Task List[ ] Remove RESPONSE_PHYSICS chart component.[ ] Insert Outbound_Velocity_Monitor (xx/100 logic).[ ] Adjust TopBar_ActiveCall container width and flex spacing.[ ] Update useCallStore to track and save the "Sentiment" selected during the HUD intervention.
